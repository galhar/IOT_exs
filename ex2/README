Files written by us:
	main.c - A program that usses MQTT protocol and does a simple task - it initiates an 
		internet  connection with a hard-coded broker, connect to it, sends it a PUBLISH
		request with our information, and disconnects. It prints the progress.

	MQTTClient.c - Implements a simple MQTTClient implementation, that only deals
		with the mqtt net settings of the code, that relies on the socket library from ex1.

	MQTTClient.h - Header file of a imple MQTTClient implementation, that only deals 
		with the mqtt net settings of the code, that relies on the socket library from ex1.

	socket.h - Header file of a socket library that allows to connect to a socket, read,
		write and disconnect.

	socket_linux.- Implementsa socket library that allows to connect to a socket, read,
		write and disconnect.

Remarks
--------------
Most of our work was to create the main.c and most of the code is there.
