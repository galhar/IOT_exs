Files written by us:
	main.c - A program that usses MQTT protocol and does a simple task - it initiates an 
		internet  connection with a hard-coded broker, connect to it, sends it a PUBLISH
		request with our information, and disconnects. It prints the progress. All of it 
		over the cellular.
	
	cellular.h - A header file for functions to work with cellular over the modem.
	
	cellular.c - Implementation file for functions to work with cellular over the modem

	socket.h - A header file for functions to work with sockets.

	socket_linux_modem.c - Implementation file for functions to work with sockets

	MQTTClient.c - Implements a simple MQTTClient implementation, that only deals
		with the mqtt net settings of the code, that relies on the socket library from ex1.

	MQTTClient.h - Header file of a imple MQTTClient implementation, that only deals 
		with the mqtt net settings of the code, that relies on the socket library from ex1.

	serial_io.h - A header file for functions to work with serial commands.

	serial_io_linux.c - Implementation file for functions to work with serial commands
