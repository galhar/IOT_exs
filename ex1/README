Remarks
--------------
In socket_linux.c most of the function are base function from sys/socket.h. the only complicated function
is the init socket because we need to translate a hostname to IP address. we used the function gethostbyname
to do so.
In HTTP_client.c we implemented a simple http dlient. We decided to limit the http response header to 8192
as we saw akami servers do. The timeout chosen is 1 second. We Made sure the reponse message will have a 
null terminator byte at the end to avoid string formatting attack.
