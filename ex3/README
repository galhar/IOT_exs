Submitted Files
-------------------------
README - This file
main.c - A file that tests the communication with the modem with simple 
	commands sent and their answers recieved. Assumes that the modem is 
	turned on while the program is running. 
serial_io.h - A header file for functions to work with the modem - send, recieve, 
	initialize, flushing it's buffer, and disabling the serial port.
serial_io.c - Implementation file for functions to work with the modem - send, 
	recieve, initialize, flushing it's buffer, and disabling the serial port.

Remarks
--------------
There is a function in the main file called sendAndRecive, thats function sending
a command and waiting for a specific answer from the modem. when this answer 
arriving its returning and the main function continue.
We used file descriptor for the serial connection and we using the syscalls read 
and write to communicate with the modem. to change the settings of the connection 
we using tcgetattr and tcsetattr functions.
