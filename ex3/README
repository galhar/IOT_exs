Files written by us:
	main.c - A program that usses MQTT protocol and does a simple task - it initiates an 
		internet  connection with a hard-coded broker, connect to it, sends it a PUBLISH
		request with our information, and disconnects. It prints the progress.

	MQTTClient.c - Implements a simple MQTTClient implementation, that only deals
		with the mqtt net settings of the code, that relies on the socket library from ex1.

	MQTTClient.h - Header file of a imple MQTTClient implementation, that only deals 
		with the mqtt net settings of the code, that relies on the socket library from ex1.

	socket.h - Header file of a socket library that allows to connect to a socket, read,
		write and disconnect.

	socket_linux.- Implementsa socket library that allows to connect to a socket, read,
		write and disconnect.

Remarks
--------------
Most of our work was to create the main.c and most of the code is there.
The host and other features like qos, port, keep alive, cmd timeout,  connection 
timeout, topic name, clientID.
The buffer is set to be 100 bytes size.
The function mqtt_message_cb is there for possible future use. We could set it to
do nothing and nothing in our actions would have changed. It's in case we will 
want to subscribe as well.
